Build fast, relevant, full-text search capabilities on top of your data in the cloud

This Full Text Search Guide teaches the foundations and enhancements, so you can build large-scale full text search applications without managing indexes, hardware or replication.

üå©Ô∏è **Foundations** - Start with building a full text search application from scratch in under 100 lines of Python code, then continue to apply additional search-native functions like autocomplete, scoring, highlighting and more.

üåå **Patterns & Use Cases** - Combine your knowledge from Foundations and apply it to solve actual business problems. Examples include real world use cases such as relevance score boosting in a restaurant search engine.

üç± **Architecture** - Full Text Search doesn't live in a bubble, the data needs to come in and often out as well. Learn how others integrate technologies such as Kafka and S3 into their Full Text Search stack to scale effortlessly.

üì¶ **Miscellaneous** - Other content that didn't fit the categories above. This includes examples on using the API to create custom synonym mapping layers, testing search index consistency latency, and more.
