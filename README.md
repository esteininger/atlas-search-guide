# Atlas Full Text Search Assets & Patterns

The purpose of this repository is to teach the foundations of __Atlas Full Text Search__ (which uses Lucene on the backend) in order to then use our knowledge to build search patterns.

Each category in the _Foundations_ section, below has a corresponding topic which is comprised of a Jupyter noteboook and a series of steps within to encourage learn by doing.

Be sure to also review the [common search mistakes](context/mistakes) as you continue the foundations.

## Search Foundations (Review First)

| 1  | Multi Tenant           | Ability to build search applications that limit what an end user can search for based on their tenancy.                                       
| 2  | Weighted Fields           | Implement relevance weights where some fields more important than  other fields.   
| 3  | [Advanced Scoring](patterns/3-advanced-scoring)          |  Ensure the boosted variable doesnâ€™t overwhelm the relevance of our search results.  
| 4  | Sorting           |  Using the Atlas Search near operator to sort documents based on a numeric, date, or geo field.
| 5  | Custom Analyzer         | Implement a synonym-based search functionality by leveraging the Custom Analyzers with the mapping character filter.

## Example Search Architecture

| #  | Label                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
|----|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | [Event Streaming](architecture/1-event-streaming)           | Using Realm and Kinesis, initiate a workflow where as documents are updated, they're pushed to a Kinesis queue and then pushed to Atlas to be searched.  

## Miscellaneous
