# Atlas Full Text Guide

<img src="https://webimages.mongodb.com/_com_assets/cms/integrated?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=undefined&w=1074" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

The purpose of this repository is to teach the foundations of [Atlas Full Text Search](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/), an operator within MongoDB that is belt upon Lucene Core. 

Each category in the _Foundations_ section, below has a corresponding topic which is comprised of a Jupyter noteboook and a series of steps within to encourage learn by doing.

Start with Engine, where you will re-create a search engine from scratch, then continue into search foundations and finally build complex applications. 

Note: there is a [common search mistakes](context/mistakes) section to be mindful of as you continue the foundations.

## Search Foundations (Review First)

## Search Patterns & Use Cases

| #  | Label                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
|----|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | [Multi Tenant // Shard Targeting](patterns/1-multi-tenant)           | Ability to build search applications that limit what an end user can search for based on their tenancy.                                       
| 2  | [Weighted Fields](patterns/2-weighted-fields)           | Implement relevance weights where some fields more important than  other fields.   
| 3  | [Advanced Scoring](patterns/3-advanced-scoring)          |  Ensure the boosted variable doesnâ€™t overwhelm the relevance of our search results.  
| 4  | [Sorting](patterns/4-sorting)           |  Using the Atlas Search near operator to sort documents based on a numeric, date, or geo field.
| 5  | [Custom Analyzer](patterns/5-custom-analyzer)         | Implement a synonym-based search functionality by leveraging the Custom Analyzers with the mapping character filter.
| 6  | [Faceting](#)         | Dynamically cluster search results into categories in order to drill down


## Example Search Architecture

| #  | Label                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
|----|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | [Event Streaming](architecture/1-event-streaming)           | Using Realm and Kinesis, initiate a workflow where as documents are updated, they're pushed to a Kinesis queue and then pushed to Atlas to be searched.  

## Miscellaneous
